# CI to the DangerZone

A basic Flame based game to demonstrate concepts for using Lua based scripting in a game, including use of code signing.

Incidentally also provides an example of how to use the sprite stacking technique in Flame, though really you should use the excellent [Sashimi](https://pub.dev/packages/sashimi) package from @wolfenrain to handle sprite stacking in Flame games.

The stacked sprite assets are from the [sprite stack cars pack by Edu](https://edusilvart.itch.io/sprite-stack-cars).
